This is Homework Day 5.

The objective is to read a .csv and then print out the result as follows:

         Fall 2016   Spring 2016
Mean:       88.38       85.86
Median:     88.5        87.0
STD:         6.41       10.41

MODULES IMPORTED:
from csv import reader;
from statistics import mean, median, stdev, StatisticsError;

FUNCTIONS USED:
MeanMedianStdev: This returns the Mean, Median and standard deviation.
Table: Takes in a bunch of dictionaries (spread operators). Each dictionary entered should have the YEAR as the KEY and the VALUES should be in the form of dict(mean:... median... stdev: ...). This function returns a table.

***** JANUARY 26, 2025 UPDATE *****

Please see new changes. Added some new function(s) and elaborated on my error handling to catch more errors.
